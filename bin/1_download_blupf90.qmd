## Downloading the BLUPF90 Software to the Command Line/Terminal

More info for working on the command line can be found here: https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

### Binary Directory

You will need to create a binary directory in a logical place within your project/computer to download the software. I made a `bin` directory in my main project directory since that project is where I am using this software. To make the directory:

`mkdir bin`

`cd bin`

I moved into this directory once I made it since that is where I want to download the software.

### Downloading Software

To access the repository of programs, vist this website: http://nce.ads.uga.edu/html/projects/programs/ Select the operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) you're using to access the correct version for your computer.

Once in that directory, go to the `64bit` directory to access the most up to date software versions.

To download the software, you'll need to use the `wget` command to download each program. To get the link for each program, right click the program and choose to copy the link address. Once this is done, navigate back to your terminal and type this:

`wget <pasted link>`

So it would look something like this:

`wget http://nce.ads.uga.edu/html/projects/programs/Linux/64bit/blupf90+`

This will download the software to your binary directory. However, the program you've downloaded is not in an executable format. To change the format use this:

`chmod 755 <program name>`

So it would look like this:

`chmod 75 blupf90+`

The programs to download for our lab include renumf90, blupf90+, gibbsf90+, and postgibbsf90.

### More Information

This link (https://masuday.github.io/blupf90_tutorial/index.html) goes to an outdated version of the BLUPF90 manual. This version is a wiki directory that I have found is easier to navigate than the up to date version and contains more useful information about software download and installation.
